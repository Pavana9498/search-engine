page.\n   Brent Stephens, assistant professor of computer science, has received a $500,000 National Science Foundation CAREER award. His project aims to rethink the way that distributed computing systems are implemented and deployed. The CAREER award is the National Science Foundation\u2019s most prestigious honor in support of early-career faculty. Since arriving at UIC, Stephens has received two other grants in support of his work. He received a Google Faculty Award in 2018 and the following year received a $175,000 NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) grant. Stephens came to UIC in 2018 after working for several years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He earned his PhD in computer science at Rice University. His work is largely at the intersection of networking, operating systems, and computer architecture. More specifically, Stephens is focused on addressing one of the biggest challenges in computing today: the need to scale application performance. Scaling application performance is key not only to support the continued growth of important existing services in computing such as search and email, but also to enable new computationally intense applications that rely on machine learning, such as self-driving cars. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to scale application performance by improving the efficiency of a single computer. For more than 40 years, that had been the case. Transistors became ever smaller, allowing the density of transistors on each microchip to double roughly every two years. These more powerful chips increased the speed of central processing units, or CPUs\u2014the part of a computer where most calculations take place\u2014by 40 percent, without a corresponding increase in power consumption. Today, CPUs have reached the upper limits of those gains. According to Stephens, a single computing core within a network can generate about 35 to 40 gigabits per second (Gbps), which can also be quantified as six million packets per second\u2014a level of performance that has not changed significantly over the past five years. By contrast, the performance of networks as a whole is continuing to increase: exponentially, in fact, to rates of 100 gigabits per second and beyond. \u201cThis means there is an ever-increasing gap in between the amount of data we can consume, process, and generate on a CPU, and the amount of data the network can carry,\u201d Stephens explained. To address the problems created by this performance gap, Stephens is working on a few research projects that share a common theme. He is moving computation from computers attached to the network into the network itself, which can overcome the limitations of existing systems, and he\u2019s continuing to scale application-level performance to meet the needs of existing and emerging applications. Stephens\u2019 CAREER award proposal, titled \u201cNIC-Accelerated Active Messaging as a Generic Replacement for RDMA,\u201d is an extension of the work he did with his Google grant. In this project, he is rethinking the design of server-side networking with a new networking framework called Network Interface Card (NIC) Accelerated Active Messaging (NAAM). In NAAM, functions are written in a high-level language, then compiled to a bytecode, which is a simple, faster code for processing, and verified before they are executed on a network interface card. This new paradigm enables accelerating message processing and offloading of computation from the main processors, while providing a simple and expressive interface to application programmers. Stephens sees this as an improvement over Remote Direct Memory Access, or RDMA, an existing technology that allows computers in a\u00a0network\u00a0to exchange data in main memory without involving the processor of either computer. While RDMA is fast, it presents challenges for developers and suffers from harmful performance variations that are hard to predict. \u201cRDMA network cards have advanced functionality, but no one is willing to use them because they are difficult to use, and the underlying network is essentially incompatible with them,\u201d Stephens said. His first NSF grant focuses on a related area: controlling the flow of data in a network to prevent packet loss, which occurs when one or more packets of data travelling across a computer network fail to reach their destination. \u201cAs soon as your input rate is greater than your service rate, things are going to continue piling up, which is called congestion,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cBuffer space isn\u2019t infinite in computers, so that\u2019s really where packet loss comes from.\u201d While cutting down on packet loss will help, a shift to a new networking framework can solve some of the limitations present in current hardware and improve server-utilization efficiency, Stephens believes. \u201cBuying lots of servers and not using them all is wasteful, especially from an environmental perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of this push comes from extracting as much performance as we can from these servers.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s about creating new programming paradigms and frameworks for executing these programs as well as new approaches for handling congestion that overcome these non-starter limitations on current RDMA hardware.\u201d For more

machine-learning algorithms affect many of our everyday decisions: they can make recommendations on what to buy, what news to read, or whom to date. These algorithms do what they do by examining our previous choices and the choices of people who are similar to us. What they do not typically consider is the downstream impact of these recommendations: how we feel or how our perspectives change as a result. It\u2019s a missing piece that concerns Elena Zheleva, assistant professor of computer science. She hopes to resolve the problem by infusing \u201ccausal inference\u201d into how algorithms are designed. Zheleva offered an example of a Twitter post containing fringe political content. \u201cAn algorithm doesn\u2019t consider how this tweet that is recommended to you will impact your life,\u201d she said. \u201cWould it enhance your life in some way, or would it contribute to radicalizing you?\u201d Gaining insight into causality\u2014how different recommendations or interventions can help or harm us\u2014is what Zheleva hopes to infuse into machine-learning algorithms, helping to reshape how they work. \u201cMachine-learning algorithms are used to impact many decisions in our life. That\u2019s something [that] recommendation algorithms control, and we should be aware of the impact,\u201d Zheleva said\u2014especially whether the effect is negative or positive. There is little research on how algorithms can maximize positive impact based on data collected in online settings, especially in rapidly changing environments. Zheleva has received grants to investigate solutions to this problem: one from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and another from Anthem. The DARPA grant, which is in collaboration with the University of Southern California, isn\u2019t solely about how algorithms affect the way people feel or what they perceive, but rather how algorithms can influence how people perform. She is studying human performance in several venues: online games, language-learning applications, and Stack Exchange, a network of question-and-answer websites where users vote on the questions and answers posted by others, leading the most highly endorsed posts to rise in reputation. Zheleva\u2019s algorithms will detect and analyze changes in a user\u2019s performance and use that analysis to suggest tailored ways to improve attention and motivation. Her algorithm accounts for factors such as a user\u2019s experience with a platform, the length of the user\u2019s current session, and decisions that users make within sessions or games. \u201cWe are looking different game characteristics that could affect team success,\u201d Zheleva said. For instance, if a user\u2019s character gains or loses power in an online game, that may make some players become more fiercely competitive but cause others to lose interest and disengage. An algorithm that can keep a user engaged by recognizing and accommodating that person\u2019s strengths and weaknesses could lead to a more successful outcome\u2014depending on how you look at it, for the user, the platform, or both. Zheleva\u2019s other research project, funded by Anthem, is a collaboration with Houshang Darabi, an associate professor in UIC\u2019s mechanical and industrial engineering department. In this study, Zheleva is analyzing large-scale longitudinal patient data to figure out which personalized interventions can optimize health outcomes. For instance, if a person quits or cuts down on smoking, that can lead to a significant decrease in medical costs. Individuals\u2019 attributes, such as their genetics, environment, and pre-existing conditions, can amplify or diminish the causal effects of their smoking. Zheleva\u2019s work will use causal inference methods to predict what the outcome would have been if a person who received treatment had received a different medical intervention instead.

Here are some reasons why: UIC students have placed highly in these\u00a0hackathon events: Research experiences for undergraduates\u2014called REUs for short\u2014offer undergraduate students the opportunity to complete career-building research projects over the summer. REUs are competitive (with students chosen for the research positions by application) and often are held at universities other than your home institution. They are sponsored with funding from the National Science Foundation and typically come with a stipend that you can use to cover living expenses and other costs. REUs make excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 entries and offer valuable hands-on experience that you can talk about in job interviews. If you have your eye on a master\u2019s degree or PhD after graduation, REUs provide a head start on building your research experience and could give you insight on what you might like to pursue in graduate school. Think of REUs as a great way to get research experience while trying out living in a different place. Select current REUs (use the search function below to find more): The deadlines for these 2020 REUs have passed, but we are leaving them listed here in case you want to reach out to the sponsoring organizations to ask whether there is still an opportunity to apply. \nSkip to the content of this page,\n     \nSearch the site\n Search the site \n      Toggle Menu\n       \nSearch\n Search
